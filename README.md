#What is keyEvt.js?
KeyEvt.js is a javascript library made by me :D EatMyBytes that allows for easy access to user key input.

#How does it work?
When a user presses a key on their keyboard keyEvt takes that keycode, matches it up with the value of the key on the keyboard and returns that value to the programmer.

#So whats my benifit?
You can see if a user pressed any key with a simple js if statement.
